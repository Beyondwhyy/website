<font size="4" ><p class="marg">Before we dig into AI in general and Machine Learning in specific, we want to mention a few things about this blog series. We understand that AI is a hot topic these days and there are thousands of blogs out there on the topic, but where we want to stand out is in our simplicity, we want complete newbies to feel comfortable without compromising on the content. We don't want to hype about AI and raise your expectations unnecessarily. There is that possibility &amp; that's what a lot of blogs and youtube channels out there are doing. The idea sold to you by these people that AI is this mega technology that solves all of mankind's problems is a false narrative. AI has some huge potential, but nowhere near what you are possibly imagining in our head.</p> 

<p class="marg">We are going to base the content of this blog series on computer scientist Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Ng</a>'s Machine Learning course at Standford university (a version of which is available on coursera). He is one of the pioneers of AI today, and we find his approach the best for beginners. In addition to this we are referring to relevant content from other books and courses, so as to provide you with the simplest and the most up to date content. We won't be sharing any assignments or solutions from Andrew Ng's course as it is simply not ethical.</p> 

<p class="marg">AI is a field with significant amount of math depending on what you trying to achieve, and we wouldn't lie that knowledge in math is unnecessary. We will cover all the math portions in detail in the most intuitive manner possible, but still a fair grip over high school math will come in handy. This shouldn't put off any newbies, you just need to work a teeny bit harder.Â </p> 

<p class="marg">We understand the enormity of the task at hand, but we will try to give you the best content possible.</p> 

<p class="marg">Thank you!</p></font>
