	<h3>Description</h3>

	<font size="4"><p class="marg">Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a subject of central importance in engineering and the applied sciences. Signals are information-bearing functions, and DSP deals with the analysis and processing of signals (by dedicated systems) to extract or modify information. Signal processing is necessary because signals normally contain information that is not readily usable or understandable, or which might be disturbed by unwanted sources such as noise. Although many signals are nonelectrical, it is common to convert them into electrical signals for processing. Most natural signals (such as acoustic and biomedical signals) are continuous functions of time, with these signals being referred to as analog signals. Prior to the development of DSP, Analog Signal Processing (ASP) and analog systems were the only tools to deal with analog signals. Although analog systems are still widely used, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and digital systems are attracting more attention, mainly due to the significant advantages of digital systems over their analog counterparts. These advantages include superiority in performance, speed, reliability, efficiency of storage, size and cost. In addition, DSP can solve problems that cannot be solved using ASP, like the spectral analysis of multi-component signals, adaptive filtering, and operations at very low frequencies. Following the recent developments in engineering which occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, DSP became one of the world’s fastest growing industries. Since that time DSP has not only impacted on traditional areas of electrical engineering, but has had far reaching effects on other domains that deal with information such as economics, meteorology, seismology, bioengineering, oceanology, communications, astronomy, radar engineering, control engineering and various other applications.</p>

	<p class="marg">DSP is a very math intensive subject and one would require a deep understanding in mathematics to understand various aspects of DSP. We believe to explain science with mathematics takes skill, but to explain science without mathematics takes even more skills. Although there are many books which cover DSP, most of them or all of them would require a ton of mathematics to understand even the most fundamental concepts. For a first timer in DSP, getting their heads around advanced math topics like Fourier transform etc. is a very hard task. Most students tend to lose interest in DSP, because of this sole reason. Students don't stick around long enough to discover how beautiful a subject DSP is.</p>

	<p class="marg">In this book, we’ve explained the various fundamental concepts of DSP in an intuitive manner with minimum math. Also, we’ve tried to connect the various topics with real life situations wherever possible. This way even first timers can learn the basics of DSP with minimum effort. Hopefully the students will enjoy this different approach to DSP. The various concepts of the subject are arranged logically and explained in a simple reader-friendly language with MATLAB examples.</p>

	<p class="marg">This book is not meant to be a replacement for those standard DSP textbooks, rather this book should be viewed as an introductory text for beginners to come in grips with advanced level topics covered in those books. This book will hopefully serve as inspiration to learn DSP in greater depths.</p><br>
