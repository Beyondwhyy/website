	<p class="marg">Richard Feynman was an exceptional man, his work as a physicist was extraordinary. He was awarded the Nobel  prize for his work in physics in 1965. But there was something else that made him stand out from all the other physicists of his time, his "Teaching" skills. There was none better. He was an exceptional explainer, for the lack of a better word. He could convey the most complex topics in physics in the most eloquent and enthralling manner. </p>

	<p class="marg">How was he able to do this? How could he learn different topics in such detail? Ofcourse he was no ordinary man, but there are a few tips we could take from the great man. Feyman had a system, a technique to learn stuff. In James Gleickâ€™s biography of Feynman, he calls it the "Feynman Technique".</p>

	<p class="marg">The Feynman technique can be summarized into 4 steps:

	<ol>
		<li>Pick a topic of your choosing. Then in a fresh notebook write down everything you already know about this topic. Then learn all you can about this topic and write that down too.</li>
		<li>Now pretend you are teaching everything you learnt abt this topic to a child. Obviously the child will have a barrage of questions. Why? How? Which? What? </li>
		<li>In your mind, try answering these questions. The ones you can't answer will reveal the gaps in your knowledge.</li>
		<li>The final step is to go back and fill out these gaps in your knowledge. Then repeat these steps again and again, until your are left with no more questions.</li>
	</ol>
