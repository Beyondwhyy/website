<p class="marg">In 1831, Michael Faraday performed some experiments with a bunch of bar magnets and some coils, and in the process came up with some laws. In one of his experiments, he moved around a bar magnet through a coil connected to an ammeter. He observed that the ammeter showed deflection.</p>

<p class="marg">In another experiment, he placed 2 coils close to each other, one connected to a varying current source and the other to an ammeter. Here too the ammeter showed some deflection.</p>

<br><p><img src="../electromagnetism_images/faraday2.png" width="300" class="bigimg"></p><br>

<p class="marg">Based on these experiments Michael Faraday formulated 2 laws, which is now known as the Faraday’s Laws. These laws introduce us to the phenomenon called Electromagnetic Induction.</p>

<p class="marg">According to the Faraday’s first law,<strong><em> when a conductor is placed in a varying magnetic field, an EMF gets induced across the conductor and if the conductor offers a closed circuit then an induced current flows through it.</em></strong></p>

<p class="marg">And Faraday’s second law states that,<strong><em> the induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux.</em></strong></p>

<p class="marg">The important thing to note here is that the magnetic field must be varying. A stationary magnetic field cannot induce a magnetic field. Which brings us to our next question, how do we obtain a varying magnetic field?</p>

<p class="marg">There are two ways to obtain varying magnetic field:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p class="marg">One is relative spatial movement, that is if the distance between the magnet and the conductor keeps changing, the magnetic field also keeps changing and induction is possible. (as in faraday’s first experiment)</p></li>

	<li><p class="marg">The other is to vary the magnetic field originating from the source itself. This is not possible with permanent magnets, but it’s easy to do using current carrying coils. All we need to do is to vary the current through the coils, the magnetic field also varies as a result. (as in faraday’s second experiment)</p></li></ol>

<p class="marg">Electromagnetic Magnetic induction occurs if either of these conditions are satisfied. Electromagnetic induction is the main principle behind the working of devices like transformers, motors etc.
