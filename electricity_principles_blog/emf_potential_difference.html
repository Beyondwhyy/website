<p class="marg">EMF stands for Electromotive force. The name may give you the impression that electromotive force is a type of force. But it is not. Actually, the EMF or the Electromagnetic force is an energy (an electric field) that causes the electrons in a material to flow in one common direction and thereby facilitating the flow of an electric current through the circuit or the device. This means that a current can flow in a circuit or a device, only if an EMF is provided. Sources of EMF can be batteries, solar cells, generators etc. EMF is denoted by the symbol E and is measured in unit Volt (V).</p>

<p class="marg">Both EMF and Potential difference are closely related quantities and are often used interchangeably in many places, but they aren’t the same. When a current flows through a material, the electrons are accelerated in one direction due to the applied EMF. But these electrons don’t gain much velocity, because they keep colliding with ions in the material and due to this the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted to heat. What this means is that, the electrons at one end of the material has more energy than the electrons at the other end, which leads to a potential difference. This obviously is a rough explanation, the actual physics behind phenomenon is more complex. It is important to note that, Potential difference is always measured between 2 points and never at a single point.</p>

<p class="marg">To sum up, the EMF is the driving energy that keeps electrons in motion and the Potential difference is the difference in energy of the electrons as a current is passed through a material. Both EMF and Potential difference have the common unit Volt (V). The term Voltage can be used in place of Potential difference or EMF.</p>
