<p class="marg">From the previous discussion, it must be pretty clear that the Voltage and the Current are two closely related quantities. They have a cause effect relation as given by this general equation:</p> 

<br><p><img src="../electricity_principles_images/ohms1.png" width="250" class="bigimg"></p><br>

<p class="marg">Where the Voltage is the cause and the Current is the effect. Now the question is, what could possibly be the opposition to current? This is where we introduce a quantity called Resistance. The concept of Resistance is analogous to friction in mechanics. Every material has a tendency to oppose current, but some more than the others. Materials with large no. of free electrons like metals have low resistance or a low tendency to oppose current. Such materials are called Conductors. Whereas materials with small no. of free electrons like plastic have high resistance. Such materials are called Insulators. And some materials fall in between, they offer some resistance, but not very high either. They are called Semi-conductors. </p>

<p class="marg">Substituting the terms in the general relation we get,</p>

<br><p><img src="../electricity_principles_images/ohms2.png" width="350" class="bigimg"></p><br>

<p class="marg">The result is this beautiful equation called the Ohm’s Law, named after the German physicist and mathematician <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm">Georg Simon Ohm</a>. The Ohm's law one of the most fundamental relations in electrical engineering.</p>

<p class="marg"> The Ohm’s law essentially implies that, the current flowing through a material/circuit is directly proportional to the Voltage applied across it, provided that the resistance of the material remain fixed. So if we were to apply twice the voltage across a bulb, twice the amount of current would flow through it or if we apply one third the voltage, then one third the current would flow.</p>

<p class="marg">The Ohm's law can be graphically represented as,</p>

<p class="marg">The Unit of Resistance is Ohm and is denoted by the Greek letter Ω.</p>
