<p class="marg">Charges in motion constitute an Electric current. Obviously the protons can’t move, because they are inside the nucleus. And the electrons close to the nucleus are held tightly by the force of attraction, so they can’t move either. So the only way an Electric current is produced is through movement of outer electrons, called the free electrons (it’s a little different in electronics though).</p> 

<p class="marg">To understand this better, consider the inside section of a Conductor as shown below.</p>

<br><p><img src="../electricity_principles_images/current1.png" width="500" class="bigimg"></p><br>

<p class="marg">As mentioned in the last section, conductors are substances which have tons of free electrons and these free electrons keep moving in random direction (due to thermal energy). Each of these small movements contribute to an Electric current locally. You might be thinking, if an electric current is produced this easily in a conductor, why do we need batteries and generators and power plants and stuff. Can’t we just hook up a small piece of copper wire to a bulb and be done with it. Unfortunately, that won’t work. That’s because the currents produced by each free electron are in random direction (in accordance with the direction of their motion) and when we consider the conductor as a whole, these currents cancel each other out and net current is zero.</p>

<p class="marg">The way out of this problem is to make all the free electrons drift in one direction and thus the net Electric Current adds up to a non-zero value. To do this all we need is a little effort, a force of sorts, called the <a href="../electricity_principles_blog/emf_voltage.html">EMF</a> or the Electromotive Force. </p>

<p class="marg">So the Electric Current can be defined as the rate of flow of charge(electrons). Mathematically,</p>

<br><p><img src="../electricity_principles_images/current2.png" width="100" class="bigimg"></p><br>

<p class="marg">The unit of current is Ampere, named after French mathematician and physicist <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie_Amp%C3%A8re">André-Marie Ampère</a>. One ampere of current represents one coulomb of electrical charge moving past a specific point in one second.</p>

<p class="marg">Prior to electricity being identified with the electron, it was thought that the movement of positive charges is what produced the electric current. For this reason, the direction of current was assumed to be in the direction of flow of positive charges. Such a current is termed as conventional current. Later on, as it was established that the movement of electrons is what is actually responsible for electric current. This current is termed as Electron current and its direction assumed to be opposite to the flow of electrons. For analysis purposes it is easier imagine current as the flow of positive charges.</p>
